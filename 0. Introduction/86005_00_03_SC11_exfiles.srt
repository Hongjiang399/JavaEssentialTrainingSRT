2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:08,213
在光盘上观看本课程，你将会找到
are watching this course on a disc, you'll have access to the Exercise Files

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,213
随课程的练习文件
that are delivered with the course.

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:15,213
我已把练习文件复制到桌面，你可以把文件放到你电脑中的任何位置
I've copied the Exercise Files to my Desktop, but you can place them anywhere on your system.

5
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:20,213
练习文件包含了一系列的Java工程文件
The Exercise Files for this course consists of a set of Java project files built

6
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:24,213
均由Eclipse软件创建，但文件中的源代码能用于
for use in Eclipse, but the source code in these project files can be used in

7
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,213
任何Java开发环境当中
any Java development environment.

8
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:29,213
我电脑中有一个名为.metadata的文件
On my system there is a file named .metadata.

9
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:33,213
如果你还没开启Eclipse你不会看到这个文件，但
You won't see it on your system if you haven't opened Eclipse yet, but it will

10
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:37,213
一旦你做本课程的练习这个文件将会被自动创建
be created automatically as you work through the course's exercises.

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,213
每一章对应练习文件中的一个文件夹
Each chapter is represented by a folder in the main Exercise Files folder.

12
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:46,213
例如第03章有4个子文件夹
So for example Chapter 03 has a set of four subfolders.

13
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,213
每个子文件夹均为一个Eclipse工程
Each of these subfolders is an Eclipse project.

14
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:54,213
例如名为APIDocs的文件夹包含有
For example the APIDocs folder contains an Eclipse project for learning

15
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,213
用于学习API文档的Eclipse工程
about API documentation.

16
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,213
在文件夹内你能看到包含Java源程序的src文件夹
Within this folder you'll see a source folder that contains the actual Java

17
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:06,213
以及一个bin文件夹，对应被编译过的可执行文件
source code and a bin folder where the application is being compiled.

18
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:11,213
如果你用的是Windows系统，你同时会看到.classpath和.project两个文件
If you are working on Windows you'll also see these two files .classpath and .project.

19
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:15,213
这些文件是由Eclipse所生成的，用于配置
These are files that are generated by Eclipse and that are used to configure

20
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,213
对应的Eclipse工程
the Eclipse project.

21
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:22,213
如果你用的是Mac系统，你可能看不到这些文件，但它们仍然存在
If you are working on Mac you might not see these files in Finder but they are still there.

22
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:27,213
下面介绍如何使用每个工程文件
Here is how you use each project.

23
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,213
我打开Eclipse，在随后课程中我将会展示如何安装这个软件
I'll open Eclipse, which I'll show you how to install very early in the

24
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:35,213
我向你展示在这个Eclipse中我已经打开了4个工程文件
course, and I'll show you that in this copy of Eclipse I already have four projects open.

25
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:38,213
我将导入另一个工程文件
Now I am going to import another project.

26
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:44,213
在菜单栏中我选择File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace
From the menu I'll choose File> Import>Existing Projects into Workspace.

27
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:49,213
我点击Browse并找到我的练习文件夹
I'll click Browse and navigate to my Exercise Files.

28
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:54,213
若我选择这个文件夹作为根目录，那么我会看到所有工程文件
If I choose this folder as my root folder I'll see all available projects

29
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:59,213
整个文件夹包含了课程所有刚开始的工程以及
throughout the entire folder including all of the beginning projects and all of

30
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:01,213
所有解决方案工程
the solution projects.

31
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:06,213
另一方法：你也可以导入其中一章的工程
Alternatively you might decide you just want to import one chapter's worth of projects.

32
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:11,213
我选择了第4章Primitives，现在我看到了短得多的文件列表
I'll choose 04_Primitives and now I'll see a much shorter list.

33
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:15,213
或者你也可以只导入单独一个工程
Or you can choose to import just a single project.

34
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:21,213
这次我选择了第4章Primitives->Booleans，并点击OK，我就只看见
This time I'll choose 04_Primitives> Booleans and click OK, and I'll see only the

35
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,213
属于此文件夹的一个工程
project in that folder.

36
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:27,213
无论你导入单独一个工程、一整章或者课程的所有工程
Whether you import one project at a time or a whole chapter or all the projects

37
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:31,213
这都取决于你自己
for the entire course it's completely up to you.

38
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:35,213
当你完成了一个工程，我建议你至少要关闭它，或者
When you are done with a project I recommend that you at least close it or

39
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:37,213
你也可以在Eclipse中删除它
optionally delete it from Eclipse.

40
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:43,213
关闭工程只需要右击工程列表的工程并选择关闭
To close a project right-click on it in the Package Explorer and close the project.

41
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:47,213
如果你想完全退出工程，只需要选择工程
If you prefer to get rid of the project completely just select the project

42
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,213
然后按下删除
folder and press Delete.

43
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:54,213
你将会被提示从Eclipse工作空间中删除工程
You'll be prompted to remove the project from the Eclipse workspace.

44
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:58,213
不要选这个选项，这样工程文件将依然保存在硬盘中
Don't check this option and then the project will still be there on disc.

45
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:02,213
如果你选了这个选项，那么你实际上不仅删除了工程而且还
If you do check the option you are actually deleting the project and all of

46
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:07,213
删除了位于硬盘上的源代码，那样你就需要从练习文件中重新解压出来了
its source code from the disc and you'll have to extract it from the Exercise Files again.

47
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:11,213
这就是怎么使用本课程的练习文件的方法
So that's a look at how to work with the exercise files for this course.

48
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:16,213
如果你无法获取练习文件，那么你可以使用你自己的Java源代码
If you don't have access to the Exercise Files you can use your own Java code.

49
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:20,213
本课程的每个视频中我会展示我正编写的所有代码
In each video in the course I'll show you all of the code that I am working with.

50
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:24,213
因此你可以复制视频中的代码到你的应用中，或者你也可以创建
So you can either copy that code into your application or you can create

51
00:03:24,213 --> 00:56:01,213
你自己的代码并随之开始学习Java编程语言
your own custom code as you begin the process of learning the Java programming language.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
