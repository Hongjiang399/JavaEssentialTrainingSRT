4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:10,213
你可能会考虑这门课程是否适合你，本课程建议你
You might be asking yourself whether this is the right course for you, and here

5
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:12,213
考虑以下几个方面。
are some questions to ask.

6
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,213
首先，你想开发怎么样的软件？
First of all, what kind of software do you want to create?

7
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:19,213
Java可以用于多种应用软件的开发
Java is used to program a variety of applications.

8
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:24,213
你可以用Java来开发基于servlets、Java Server Pages (简称JSP)等
You can use Java to build Web-based dynamic applications using programming

9
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:29,213
此类编程模型的动态网页应用。
models known as servlets or Java Server Pages, also known as JSP.

10
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:34,213
Java也可以用来开发移动应用，例如应用于平板电脑和手机等

00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:43,213
还有很多其他类型的利用Java开发的应用
And there are many other types of applications you can build with Java, and I'll

13
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,213
我将会在以后的视频中提及。
explain some of these in later videos.

14
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:48,213
另外，Java跟很多其他语言是有区别的。
There are some things however that Java is not.

15
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:50,213
Java不是JavaScript
Java is not JavaScript.

16
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:55,213
JavaScript是与所有现代网页浏览器相结合的一门动态脚本语言
JavaScript is the dynamic scripting language that's incorporated into all modern

17
00:00:55,213 --> 00:01:00,213
用于创建动态网页应用，其代码
Web browsers and is used to create dynamic applications where the application

18
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:03,213
能被浏览器直接运行
code is executed by the browser itself.

19
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:07,213
虽然Java和JavaScript都有"Java"字样，但它们是
Even though Java and JavaScript share the term Java, they are very

20
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:09,213
两门不同的语言
different languages.

21
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:13,213
在语法和外观方面它们有相似之处，但你运行它们的方式
They have some similarities in their syntax and appearance, but the way you use

22
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:17,213
以及它们内部的运行机制是有根本区别的。
them and the way they work internally is completely different.

23
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:21,213
如果你想要学习如何搭建动态网页，且其代码
So if your goal is to learn how to build dynamic webpages, where the code is

24
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:25,213
能够被浏览器直接运行，那么你需要学JavaScript
executed in the browser, you should be learning JavaScript.

25
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:29,213
另外Java并不能用于开发所有移动平台的应用
Java is also not used to build native mobile apps for all platforms.

26
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:34,213
它不能用于开发运用于iPhone和iPad等基于iOS系统
It isn't used to build native iOS applications that is applications for

27
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:35,213
的本地应用
the iPhone and iPad.

28
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:41,213
开发iOS应用你需学习Objective C语言以及Xcode开发软件
For that you should use Objective C and the Xcode IDE, and it's also not used to

29
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:44,213
Java也不能用于开发Windows Phone应用
build native Windows Phone applications.

30
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:49,213
Windows Phone是微软新开发的手机操作系统移动平台

31
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:54,213
那里的应用需要用到C#或VB .NET等语言以及
For those types of applications you should use either C# or VB.NET and some

32
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,213
Visual Studio开发环境
version of the Visual Studio environment.

33
00:01:57,213 --> 00:02:01,213
有些人认为Java不是世界上最简单的语言
Some people think that Java isn't the easiest language in the world.

34
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,213
因其是一门编译型语言且具有严格的语法结构
It is a compiled language and it has very strict data typing rules.

35
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:09,213
另外，你还需要了解面向对象的编程，从而更好地应用Java
And in order to be effective in Java you need to understand something

36
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,213
开发应用，我将会在以后的课程中
about object-oriented programming, but I'll be teaching you all that

37
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,213
教会你这些
during this course.

38
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:17,213
从另一角度来看，Java同时也不是世界上
And the other thing that's true of Java is that it's not the most difficult

39
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,213
最难的语言
language in the world.

40
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:22,213
Java是一门具有高度一致性的语言
Java is an incredibly consistent language.

41
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:25,213
一旦你学会了Java的语言规则，一旦你学会了从语言的角度
Once you learn the rules of Java, once you learn how to think in the

42
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,213
思考问题，你将很快能够扩展你的应用工具以及
languages' terms you will find that you can extend your tools and your

43
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:32,213
你的编程能力
