Java编程语言有很长的历史
The Java programming language has a long history.</u></b>

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:10,213
1991年，Sun微系统公司开始了名为“The Green Project”项目
It started in 1991 when Sun Microsystems began something called The Green Project.

3
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:15,213
这个项目的目标是创建一门新的可移植编程语言
The goal of The Green Project was to create a new portable programming language,

4
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:18,213
新语言用于创建可在多种操作系统上运行的应用软件
one that could be used to create applications that could be run on multiple

5
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:23,213
而不需要重新编译或移植代码
operating systems without having to recompile or port the code.

6
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:28,213
这门语言最初的名字为"Oak(橡树)",因为当时有一颗橡树
The original name of the language was Oak, for a large oak tree that stood

7
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,213
正好在发明者办公室的窗口外
outside the windows of the developers' offices.

8
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:34,213
但在项目开始至新语言被发布的这段时间内
But between the time the project began and the time the language was released,

9
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:39,213
它被重新命名为Java，因为这是当时开发者们很常喝的
it was renamed as Java supposedly because of the amount of coffee that the

10
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,213
一种咖啡
developers were drinking.

11
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:46,213
Java的首次发布是在1995年，从那之后Java经历了快速
Java was first released to the public in 1995 and thereafter saw a rapid

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,213
的改革和变化
evolution and change.

13
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:54,213
从1995年开始，“一次编写，随处运行”变得流行起来
Starting in 1995 the phrase Write Once, Run Anywhere was popularized.

14
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:58,213
也就是说，Java的目标就是实现你只需写一次源代码，你只需
Again the goal of Java was that you'd be able to write a program, you'd be able

15
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:05,213
编译一次而可以运行在Unix，Windows,Mac等
to compile it once and then run it on UNIX, on Windows, on Mac, and other

16
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:09,213
多种操作系统，只要有一个Java虚拟机环境即可
operating systems for which there was a Java virtual machine.

17
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:12,213
Java飞速发展
Java evolved swiftly.

18
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:16,213
最早几年每年都有一个新版本发布
In the early years there was a new release about once a year.

19
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:22,213
到1996年，Sun发布了第一个完整的Java开发工具(JDK)，并支持
In 1996, Sun released the first complete Java Developers Kit or JDK supporting a

20
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:28,213
一大堆应用开发任务类型，版本号1.1,接下来一年
broad range of application development tasks, version 1.1, the following year

21
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,213
的改进主要在Java的面向对象属性上，包括内部类和
saw improvements to the object- oriented nature of Java with Inner classes and

22
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:39,213
JavaBeans，JDBC应用接口(用于数据库交流), RMI(远程方法调用)
JavaBeans, the JDBC API for talking to databases, RMI or Remote Method

23
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:45,213
RMI运用于分布式系统，还有反射机制(用于改进Java的)
Invocation for distributed systems, and Reflection for improving the dynamic

24
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:47,213
(动态特性)
capabilities of the language.

25
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:55,213
到1998年，Java重塑品牌为J2SE，即Java第二个标准版本
In 1998, Java was rebranded as J2SE or Java 2 Standard Edition.

26
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:59,213
标准版本是跟企业版本区分开来的，企业版本是
The Standard Edition distinguished it from Enterprise Edition which was the

27
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:03,213
打造大型网页应用的开发框架
framework for building large scale Web applications.

28
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:07,213
版本号是Java 2，也就是Java 1.2
The version number was Java 2, version 1.2.

29
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:12,213
显得有点混乱，“J”后面的数字“2”存在了很多年
A little confusing, and the 2 after the J stuck around for many, many years, but

30
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,213
但版本的递增却用小数点后面数字表现
the versions were incremented using point numbers.

31
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:23,213
Java2SE 1.2 包含了swing图形API接口，用于创建桌面应用
Java2SE 1.2 included the swing graphical API for building Desktop applications,

32
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:28,213
collections(集合类)框架用于管理多种数据元素，还有一些新工具
the collections framework for managing multiple data elements, and new tools

33
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:33,213
包括即时编译器和Java插件，插件用于标准化
including the Just-In-Time compiler and the Java Plug-in which standardized the

34
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:35,213
Java和网页浏览器的交叉版本
version of Java across Web browsers.

35
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:42,213
两三年后J2SE 1.3版本新增了开发工具，有HotSpot虚拟机
A couple of years later J2SE 1.3 added new tools including the HotSpot JVM,

36
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:48,213
这是一个新版本的Java虚拟机，还有Java声音API接口和一些漏洞修补
a new version of the Java Virtual machine, the Java Sound API and improved debugging.

37
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:56,213
2002年的版本1.4新增了一些开发工具，到了2004年，一个主要的
In 2002 version 1.4 added new tools in the language, and then in 2004, a major

38
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:59,213
更新版本发布了，即J2SE 5.0
new release came out J2SE 5.0.

39
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:03,213
这个新版本的版本号是1.5,也是5.0
This version was known both as 1.5 and 5.0.

40
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:07,213
但后面所有新版本的发布都只采用了主版本号递增
But subsequent new releases would just use the major numbers.

41
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:10,213
也就是后来变成5.0, 6.0, 7.0...
So it'd become 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and so on.

42
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:17,213
J2SE 5.0是Java语言的一次重大改进，其中一项新特性叫Generics
J2SE 5.0 was a major new change for the language, a new feature called Generics

43
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:22,213
其作用是让你能运用强集合性元素数据类型
was implemented that lets you strongly data type collection elements.

44
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:28,213
还改进了枚举类、可变参数、以及for-each循环结构
Enumerations, variable arguments, and looping with for-each were all improved.

45
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:34,213
从语言的语法上看，那是最后一次Java语言的重大改进
And in terms of language syntax this was really the last major change to the language.

46
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,213
从那以后Java的改进都属于边角修复
Everything since then has been nibbling around the edges.

47
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:41,213
到2006年，Java 6.0发布
In 2006 Java 6.0 came out.

48
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:45,213
改进了数据库连接性能、图形化编程
It improved performance for database connectivity, improved graphical

49
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:49,213
以及增加其他一些小的特性
programming and added other small features to the language.

50
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:57,213
后来改进的脚步减缓了，从2006年到2010年Sun微系统发布的
And then the pace of change slowed, from 2006 to 2010 Sun Microsystems released

51
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:59,213
都属于临时的维护版本
occasional maintenance releases to the language.

52
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:04,213
你会看到Java 6.0的维护版本如10, 11, 12...
So you'd have Java 6.0 Maintenance Release 10, 11, 12, and so on.

53
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:10,213
到本课程为止，Java 6.0的维护版本29是最新的
And as of this recording Java 6.0 Maintenance Release 29 is the most recent

54
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,213
一个Java 6.0版本
version of that version of Java.

55
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:17,213
到了2010年，一个大事件发生了：甲骨文收购了Sun
Then in 2010 a major event occurred. Oracle bought Sun.

56
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:22,213
Sun微系统品牌以及所有资产，包括Java编程语言
Sun Microsystems and all of its assets including the Java programming language

57
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,213
都编程了甲骨文的一部分
became a part of Oracle.

58
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:29,213
到本课程的录制为止，甲骨文集团正维护运营着Java语言
And as of the time of this recording Oracle Corporation manages Java along with

59
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:34,213
以及JCP，即Sun创始的Java社区流程
JCP, the Java Community Process that Sun began.

60
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:38,213
到2011年J2SE 7发布了
In 2011 J2SE 7 was released.

61
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:44,213
其中包含了一些如列表所示的小改进，以及增加其他一些小工具
It included minor changes in the language listed here and some other small scale tools.

62
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:49,213
我们将会看到新版本的Java在未来发布，很可能会被命名
And we are expecting another version of Java down the road, possibly known as

63
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:53,213
J2SE 8.0，其中将会包含一些跟7.0版本不一样的地方
J2SE 8.0 and it would include many things that were deferred from the version

64
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:58,213
例如包含一种叫Lambda表达式或闭包
7.0 effort including something called Lambda expressions or closures.

65
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:02,213
如果你不了解这些，不必担心，现在这些都还不是
If you don't know what those are, don't worry about it, they are not currently a

66
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,213
Java语言的一部分
part of the Java language.

67
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:08,213
总之，这就是Java语言的全部历史
So that's what's happened in the world of Java since it began.

68
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:13,213
自1995年以来Java就是一个强大的存在，被用在很多
Java has been around in strength since 1995 and it's been used in a lot of

69
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,213
编程环境中，我将会介绍其中一些编程环境
programming environments, and I'll talk about some of those programming

70
00:05:16,213 --> 00:56:01,213
请见下一视频
environments in the next video.
